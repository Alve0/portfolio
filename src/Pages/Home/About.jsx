          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300">
            I started my programming journey tinkering with HTML and CSS in high
            school. Over time I fell in love with JavaScript and React â€” the way
            small components compose into useful products fascinated me. These
            days I enjoy building frontend-heavy apps with clear UX: realtime
            feedback, accessible markup, and reliable performance.

              Polishing micro-interactions, improving accessibility, and
              optimizing performance. I enjoy mentoring juniors and contributing
              to open-source tools.

              I like football, sketching UI ideas on paper, and playing with
              small electronics projects. I also love a strong cup of tea while
              listening to lo-fi beats.
